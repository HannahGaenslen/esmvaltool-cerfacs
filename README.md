# esmvaltool-cerfacs
> This GitHub repository is the result of my internship at CERFACS, in the Global Change team (April to June 2023) supervised by Marie-Pierre Moine, Laure Coquart and Rym Msadek. 

[Here](https://github.com/HannahGaenslen/esmvaltool-cerfacs/wiki) you can find some useful information on how to get started with the Earth System Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) and how to use it specifically on the CERFACS data and compute server. The repository also contains documentation on recipes which were modified for the use of CNRM-CERFACS models as well as utilities which I developed during my internship. Those utilities contain Python scripts for a systemized recipe running workflow. The ESMValTool version used here is the 2.8.0 (released end of March 2023).
